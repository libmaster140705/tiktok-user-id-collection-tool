## Problem Identification

In today's digital landscape, managing user interactions and analyzing social media engagements can become a complex challenge for developers working with platforms like TikTok. Specifically, identifying and collecting user IDs from TikTok is often fraught with difficulties. These include limitations in accessing user data through official APIs, the risk of violating platform policies, and the inefficiencies associated with manual collection methods.
